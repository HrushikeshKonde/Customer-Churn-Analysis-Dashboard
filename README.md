# Customer-Churn-Analysis-Dashboard
Customer churn analysis dashboard visualizes key metrics like churn rate, revenue loss, and retention trends. It segments churn by customer profiles, contract types, demographics, and behaviors to identify at-risk customers. The dashboard supports data-driven strategies to improve retention and reduce churn.
The file uses Python scripts for predicting customer churn dates by allowing users to input parameters such as age, gender, credit score, salary, and balance. Based on these inputs, the model applies predictive analysis to estimate the likely churn date for each customer, aiding proactive retention strategies.
